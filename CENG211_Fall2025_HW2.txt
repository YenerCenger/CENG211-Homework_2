Homework #2

In this homework, you are expected to implement a “Scholarship Evaluation System” in Java. You should fulfill the concepts of:

• Inheritance
• Polymorphism
• CSV File/IO
• Array Lists

Every year, a university’s scholarship committee receives hundreds of applications.
Each application is unique: some students excel academically, some demonstrate significant financial need, and some contribute through research and publications.

The committee has three main branches handling these cases:

• One branch focuses on academic excellence and awards scholarships based on GPA and recommendations.
• Another branch focuses on financial need, considering family income and dependents.
• The final branch supports research activities, considering publications and supervisor approvals.

Though the criteria differ, all branches follow a common evaluation framework — verifying documents, checking eligibility, and assigning the appropriate scholarship type and duration.
Your program will act as this evaluation system, automatically reviewing all applicants.

Hint:
The evaluation system should be flexible enough to handle different types of applications in the future (e.g., scholarships today, exchange programs tomorrow).
Therefore, you are encouraged to think of a general “Application” framework that scholarship applications can build upon.

Input File

A single CSV file, ScholarshipApplications.csv, contains all application information. Rows are mixed and not ordered by applicant.

Use the Applicant ID to associate the different parts of an application.

Each row starts with a prefix letter:

Prefix	Meaning	Columns
A	Applicant Info	A, applicantID, name, GPA, income
T	Transcript	T, applicantID, transcriptStatus (Y/N)
I	Family Info	I, applicantID, familyIncome, dependents
D	Document	D, applicantID, documentType, durationInMonths
P	Publication	P, applicantID, title, impactFactor

Applicants are distinguished by their ID prefix:

• 11 → Merit-based Scholarship
• 22 → Need-based Scholarship
• 33 → Research Grant

Each applicant may have several associated documents and publications.

Document Types
Code	Description
ENR	Enrollment Certificate (mandatory for all)
REC	Recommendation Letter (academic merit)
SAV	Savings Document (financial stability)
RSV	Research Supervisor Approval (research grant)
GRP	Grant Proposal (research grant)
Evaluation Rules for Scholarship
General Checks (for all applicants)

The application must include an Enrollment Certificate (ENR).

Transcript status must be Y (valid).

GPA must be ≥ 2.50.

Missing mandatory information leads to immediate rejection.

Merit-Based Scholarship

GPA ≥ 3.20 → Full Scholarship

3.00 ≤ GPA < 3.20 → Half Scholarship

GPA < 3.00 → Rejected

If a Recommendation Letter (REC) is present, scholarship duration is 2 years; otherwise 1 year.

This committee values academic excellence and recognizes recommendations from faculty as an indicator of consistent performance.

Need-Based Scholarship

Monthly income ≤ 10,000 → Full Scholarship

10,000 < income ≤ 15,000 → Half Scholarship

Income > 15,000 → Rejected

If a Savings Document (SAV) exists, income thresholds increase by 20%.

If the applicant has 3 or more dependents, thresholds increase by an additional 10%.

Scholarship duration is 1 year.

The financial committee prioritizes students who genuinely require financial support but can adapt its evaluation when families demonstrate limited savings or higher dependents.

Research Grant

At least one Publication (P) or Grant Proposal (GRP) is required.

Average impact factor ≥ 1.50 → Full Scholarship

1.00 ≤ avg impact < 1.50 → Half Scholarship

avg impact < 1.00 → Rejected

If a Research Supervisor Approval (RSV) exists, scholarship duration is extended by +1 year.

Base duration: Full → 1 year, Half → 6 months.

The research branch awards grants based on scientific contribution and supervisor validation. Outstanding research performance ensures longer support.

Rejection Reasons (priority order)

If multiple rejection reasons apply, only the first relevant one is printed:

Missing Enrollment Certificate

Missing Transcript

GPA below 2.5

Missing mandatory document

Financial status unstable

Missing publication or proposal

Publication impact too low

Expected Output Format

Example layout:

Applicant ID: 1101, Name: Liam Smith, Scholarship: Merit, Status: Accepted, Type: Full, Duration: 2 years

Applicant ID: 1114, Name: Ava Johnson, Scholarship: Merit, Status: Accepted, Type: Half, Duration: 1 year

Applicant ID: 1120, Name: Oliver Brown, Scholarship: Merit, Status: Rejected, Reason: GPA below 3.0

Applications must be printed sorted by Applicant ID.

Important Notes

You can use standard java.io packages to read files. Do NOT use other 3rd party libraries.

Use relative paths, otherwise grader prints nothing.

For Turkish characters, set project encoding to UTF8.

Write clean, readable, reusable code.

Assignment Rules

No cheating.

Submit in groups.

Export project correctly.

Submit through Teams.

Naming format must be:
G05_CENG211_HW2
and the ZIP folder must match exactly.

Wrong naming = point loss.

Submissions may be used in research; contact instructor if you don’t want that.
